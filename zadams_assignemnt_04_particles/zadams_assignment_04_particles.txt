I aimed to create a particle effect inspired by the qualities of dust in space.  I used a noise function to distort the UV space and get more naturalistic shapes as well as changing brightness based on particle position. Even though the image is constructed two dimensionally, I noticed that  the effect of overlapping particles intensified  the luminosity in those areas and created the illusion of volume. I attempted to make forms that appear to fold and bend over themselves.  I wanted some level of control over the animation where users are able to adjust different parameters like time scale, intensity, number of particles present and the color of the particles  but I wasnâ€™t able to implement  all of them.

I've noticed my computer continually accumulating and drawing in dust through its intake fans, which deposits on my graphics card. Given the computer's all-black aesthetic, these dust particles are particularly noticeable . That visual inspiration combined with the feelings I associate with viewing fine particles of dust and debris that orbit celestial bodies. I tried to recreate that ambience of fine grains in a dark void
